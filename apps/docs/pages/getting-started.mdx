# Getting Started with Next.js S3 Uploader

In this section, you will learn how to get started with **Next.js S3 Uploader**. We'll cover the prerequisites, setting up your Amazon S3 bucket, and integrating the package into both your Next.js frontend and API route.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

### Amazon S3 Bucket

You'll need an Amazon S3 bucket to store your uploaded files. Depending on your requirements, you can create a public or private bucket:

#### Public Bucket

If you want to allow public access to your uploaded files, create your S3 bucket with a public access policy. Here's an example of a public access policy:

```json {9} /your-bucket-name/
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "PublicRead",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": ["s3:GetObject"],
      "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Private Bucket

For a private bucket, you can configure Next.js S3 Uploader to generate pre-signed URLs for secure access to files. We'll cover this in more detail in the [API Refrence](/api-reference/generatePresignedUrls) section.

### Next.js Application Directory

Make sure you have a Next.js application directory set up. You'll be integrating Next.js S3 Uploader into both your frontend and API route.

## Frontend Implementation

To integrate Next.js S3 Uploader into your frontend, follow these steps:

### Import the Hook

In your Next.js component, import the `useS3FileUpload` hook from "next-s3-uploader":

```jsx
import { useS3FileUpload } from "next-s3-uploader";
```

### Use the Hook

Inside your component, use the `useS3FileUpload` hook to manage file uploads and track progress:

```jsx
function UploadPage() {
  const { uploadedFiles, uploadFiles } = useS3FileUpload({
    multiple: true, // Allow multiple file uploads (optional)
    maxFiles: 10,   // 10 files limit (optional)
    maxFileSize: 10 * 1024 * 1024, // 10MB limit (optional)
  });

  // Your file upload logic here

  return (
    // Your component JSX
  );
}
```

### Handle File Upload

Implement the logic to handle file uploads, such as selecting files and calling `uploadFiles`:

```jsx
const handleFileChange = async (e) => {
  const files = e.target.files;
  if (files && files.length > 0) {
    await uploadFiles(files);
  }
};
```

### Render Uploaded Files

Render the uploaded files using the `uploadedFiles` array:

```jsx
return (
  <div>
    <h1>File Upload to Amazon S3</h1>
    <input
      title="Upload File"
      type="file"
      accept="image/*"
      multiple
      onChange={handleFileChange}
    />
    {/* Display uploaded files and progress */}
    <div>
      {uploadedFiles.map((file, index) => (
        <div key={index}>
          <p>File Key: {file.key}</p>
          <p>Status: {file.status}</p>
          <p>Progress: {file.progress}%</p>
          <p>Time Left: {file.timeLeft || "Calculating..."}</p>
          {file.status === "success" && (
            {/* Display the uploaded image */}
            <img src={file.url} alt={`Uploaded File ${index}`} />
            {/* Or display a download link */}
            <a href={file.url} download>
              Download File
            </a>
          )}
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  </div>
);
```

## API Route Implementation

To create an API route for handling pre-signed URLs, follow these steps:

### Import Dependencies

In your API route, import the necessary dependencies from "next-s3-uploader":

```javascript filename="app/api/s3-upload.js"
import { createS3Client, generatePresignedUrls } from "next-s3-uploader";
```

### Create the API Route

Inside your API route function, configure the S3 client and generate pre-signed URLs:

<Tabs items={["AWS S3", "MinIO/S3-Compatible Provider"]} storageKey="s3-provider">
<Tab>

```javascript {7} filename="app/api/s3upload.js"
export async function POST(req) {
  try {
    const { keys } = await req.json();

    // Configure AWS S3 client
    const s3Client = createS3Client({
      provider: "aws", // Amazon S3 provider
      region: "us-east-1", // Specify the appropriate AWS region
      credentials: {
        accessKeyId: "YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID", // Your AWS access key ID
        secretAccessKey: "YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY", // Your AWS secret access key
      },
    });

    // Generate pre-signed URLs
    const bucket = "your-bucket-name";
    const prefix = `userId/images/`;
    const urls = await generatePresignedUrls(s3Client, keys, bucket, prefix);

    return new Response(JSON.stringify(urls), { status: 200 });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error processing the request:", error);
    return new Response("Internal Server Error", { status: 500 });
  }
}
```

</Tab>
{/* Minio */}
<Tab>

```javascript {7-9} filename="app/api/s3-upload.js"
export async function POST(req) {
  try {
    const { keys } = await req.json();

    // Configure S3 client
    const s3Client = createS3Client({
      provider: "minio", // Store in .env
      endpoint: "http://localhost:9000/", // Store in .env
      forcePathStyle: true, // Store in .env
      region: "ap-south-1", // Store in .env
      credentials: {
        accessKeyId: "ROOTNAME", // Store in .env
        secretAccessKey: "CHANGEME123", // Store in .env
      },
    });

    // Generate pre-signed URLs
    const bucket = "your-bucket-name";
    const prefix = `userId/images/`;
    const urls = await generatePresignedUrls(s3Client, keys, bucket, prefix);

    return new Response(JSON.stringify(urls), { status: 200 });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error processing the request:", error);
    return new Response("Internal Server Error", { status: 500 });
  }
}
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

With these steps, you'll be ready to start using Next.js S3 Uploader in your Next.js application.
