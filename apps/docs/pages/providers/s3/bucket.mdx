# Bucket Setup

## Public Bucket

If you want to allow public access to your uploaded files, create your S3 bucket with a public access policy. Here's an example of a public access policy:

```json {9} /your-bucket-name/
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "PublicRead",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": ["s3:GetObject"],
      "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_BUCKET_NAME/*"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Private Bucket

You do not need to create a public access policy if you want to keep your bucket private.

You only have to set `privateBucket` to `true` in your API route in `generatePresignedUrls()`
