# Configuration

In this section, we will explore the various configuration options available for **Next.js S3 Uploader**. Proper configuration is crucial for seamless integration and optimal performance.

We will cover:

1. [S3 Client Configuration](#s3-client-configuration)
2. [Customizing the API Endpoint](#customizing-the-api-endpoint)
3. [Access Control](#access-control)
4. [Presigned URL Expiration](#presigned-url-expiration)

## S3 Client Configuration

Before using **Next.js S3 Uploader**, you need to configure the S3 client based on your cloud storage provider.

- If you are using **Amazon S3**, the client configuration should include your AWS access key ID and secret access key. Make sure to specify the appropriate AWS region.

```javascript
const s3Client = createS3Client({
  provider: "s3", // Amazon S3 provider
  region: "us-east-1", // Specify the appropriate AWS region
  credentials: {
    accessKeyId: "YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID", // Your AWS access key ID
    secretAccessKey: "YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY", // Your AWS secret access key
  },
});
```

- If you are using a **non-AWS S3-compatible service**, like MinIO, configure the client with the service's endpoint, region, and access credentials.

```javascript
const s3Client = createS3Client({
  provider: "minio", // Non-AWS S3 provider (minio/other)
  endpoint: "http://localhost:9000", // Specify the appropriate endpoint
  region: "us-east-1", // Specify the appropriate region
  forcePathStyle: true, // Required for MinIO
  credentials: {
    accessKeyId: "ROOTNAME", // Your access key
    secretAccessKey: "CHANGEME123", // Your secret key
  },
});
```

Ensure that you configure the client correctly based on your cloud storage provider.

## Customizing the API Endpoint

By default, **Next.js S3 Uploader** uses `/api/s3upload` as the API endpoint for generating pre-signed URLs. You can specify a custom API endpoint if needed.

```jsx
const { uploadedFiles, uploadFiles } = useS3FileUpload();

const handleFileChange = async (e) => {
  const files = e.target.files;
  if (files && files.length > 0) {
    await uploadFiles(files, null, "/api/custom-upload-route");
  }
};
```

Setting a custom API endpoint allows you to integrate **Next.js S3 Uploader** into your application's routing structure.

## Access Control

Control access to your S3 bucket by defining appropriate access policies. **Next.js S3 Uploader** supports both public and private buckets.

- For **public** buckets, set a policy allowing `s3:GetObject` actions for the `"*"` principal. This allows anyone to read objects in the bucket.

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "PublicRead",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": ["s3:GetObject"],
      "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"]
    }
  ]
}
```

- For **private** buckets, specify the `privateBucket` option as `true` when generating pre-signed URLs. This ensures that uploaded files are not publicly accessible.

```jsx
const urls = await generatePresignedUrls(s3Client, keys, bucket, prefix, true);
```

Remember to properly configure access control policies based on your security requirements.

## Presigned URL Expiration

Presigned URLs are temporary, and you can set their expiration time as needed. By default, presigned URLs expire after 1 hour (3600 seconds).

```jsx
const urls = await generatePresignedUrls(
  s3Client,
  keys,
  bucket,
  prefix,
  false,
  {
    expiresIn: 1800, // Expires in 30 minutes
  }
);
```

Customize the expiration time to match your application's requirements.

With these configuration options, you can tailor **Next.js S3 Uploader** to your specific requirements and ensure it integrates seamlessly with your Next.js application.
