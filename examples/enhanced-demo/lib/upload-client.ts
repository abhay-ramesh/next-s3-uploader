 * Create the typed upload client with enhanced type inference
 *
 * This provides property-based access to upload routes:
 * - upload.imageUpload() - for image uploads
 * - upload.documentUpload() - for document uploads
 *
 * Features:
 * - Full TypeScript inference from server router
 * - Property-based access (no string literals)
 * - Compile-time type safety
 * - Enhanced IntelliSense support

/**
 * Usage Examples:
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // Property-based access with full type safety (hook factory pattern)
 * const { uploadFiles, files, isUploading, errors, reset } = upload.imageUpload();
 *
 * // Upload files with automatic route inference
 * await uploadFiles(selectedFiles);
 *
 * // Access typed file properties
 * files.map(file => (
 *   <div key={file.id}>
 *     <span>{file.name}</span>
 *     <span>{file.status}</span> // 'pending' | 'uploading' | 'success' | 'error'
 *     <progress value={file.progress} max={100} />
 *   </div>
 * ));
